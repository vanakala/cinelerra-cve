#ifndef BRENDER_H
#define BRENDER_H

// The master node of the background renderer needs a separate memory space 
// because few of the codecs are reentrant.

// To solve the problem, the master node forks itself and treats the forked 
// master node as the first node of a renderfarm.  There is no real master node
// of the renderfarm.  The BRender object is a thread in order to
// join the forked master node.

// If renderfarm is enabled, the extra renderfarm nodes are treated normally.
// Unfortunately because of the codec problem, only one copy of Cinelerra
// can be running on a single renderfarm.  This means either background 
// rendering or foreground rendering can be happening but not both.

// A BRenderThread client runs in the background and a BRender object 
// interfaces the main window.  The BRender client recieves commands to
// restart, start, and stop background rendering on its own time to avoid 
// interrupting the main window.

// Whenever a change happens to the timeline, we calculate the last position
// which hasn't changed and the end of the contiguous renderfarm output.  
// Then we restart the background renderfarm at the
// lesser of the positions.  You can't conditionally restart only 
// if one of the current jobs was after the position because you need a new EDL.

// The two problems to emerge are which job is the last job in the contiguous
// set of finished jobs and if position of change is before the last job, 
// how to truncate and restart the output file.

// It's easy to use image sequences as the output file to solve the 
// file truncation problem.
// Figuring out the end of the contiguous output means recording the
// state of every output file and constructing a kind of EDL for the 
// background output as certain output files cluster together.
// This is needed anyway for playback.
