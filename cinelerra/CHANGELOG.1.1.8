Fixed crash when slave plugin extended past master plugin with no asset
in track.

bcsignal_new_delete.diff - the meters need to have separations at 5 and
20, not 1/6 and 2/5.

bcmeter_illegal_access.diff - this function shouldn't copy the string
at all.


overlay-speedup3.diff applied

overlay-speedup4.diff rejected
	- pixel_transparency is still taken from the alpha of the pixel, which is 0 - max.
	  Bit shifting reduces the result by 1.

imagesequence.patch applied

framecache1.diff rejected
	- The cache explodes when handling HDTV.  Can't use it until you've
	finished the options in preferences and the absolute size.

close_window.diff rejected
	- too much work for something that a set_done call would do.
