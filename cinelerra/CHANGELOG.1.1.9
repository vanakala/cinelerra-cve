Command line option for alternate configure file.
Pinch works if whirl is zero.
Push method replaced by pull method in virtual console.
 - less memory
 - realtime time domain effects possible
 - no distinction between amount to read from disk and amount to send through console
Popup menu instead of text entry for playback fragment size.
Video decimation
Parametric EQ, pitch shift, time stretch have no delay.
Synchronized start of video and audio playback.
Controls can be hidden from compositor.
Mov not improperly detected as OGG Vorbis 
 - ov_open result also needs testing against first 8 bytes
Fixed histogram crashes due to not all LoadClients being called.
Attach button attaches shared effects properly.
Automatic filename generation doesn't change directory.
Nudge values updated when project rates change.
Background rendering detects nudge change.
Loading an EDL with the CWindow tool followed by loading an EDL without
	the CWindow tool crashes less.
PCM format configuration more reliable.
Freeze frame freezes on the exact frame the effect starts 
	or on the latest keyframe.
Better alignment of fade out in Titler.
Better text entry in titler.
Video overlay effect.
Realtime reverse video and audio.
Loop audio and video effects.
Colorbalance tabulation doesn't leave last entry empty
Zoom menu goes towards center instead of top left of compositor.
Middle mouse button scrolling works when compositor output is smaller than canvas.
Aspect ratio saved in mpeg video.
Default keyframe position stays at 0 after shifting effect right then left.
Batch render from command line without GUI.
Titler reverted to old freetype API.
 - 400 less lines of code and better vertical alignment.
 - the "stroker" outline looked terrible.  Outlines need to be done with a real
     outline filter.
Rendering load balancing tests for infinite frame rate.
Frame -> fields optimized for pull console.
Fields -> frame converted to realtime.
Bounds checking in crop entry point.
Credits screen.  Send omitted names to broadcast@earthling.net
Memory debug system.
An optimization error in GCC 3.3.2 causes RGB16 colormodels to crash.
Easier changing of the nudge parameters during playback.

quicktime: Memory leak in raw.c with temp_rows removed.
	RLE decoding

libmpeg3: multiple title stream handling and table of contents moved to
absolute offsets
- mpeg3toc takes -a to limit the number of audio streams scanned.


Patches (Send whining to billg@microsoft.com):



Andraz Tori:

locale.diff more language bindings
	applied
bctheme_memfix.diff different arraylist handling
	applied
cinelerra-gettext-6.diff more language bindings
	applied
sharpen.diff engine debug
	applied
buttons.diff + buttons_pngs.tar.gz 3 segment replacement for text
	rejected.  
	Why don't you add support for picons in generic buttons
	instead of requiring different 3segment bitmaps.
	Set real x and y in the initialize() instead of guessing in the constructor.
canvas_cache2.diff picon and rendering cache with preferences rejected.
	Make File work without *preferences.
	Caching picons should only involve FrameCache and ResourcePixmap.
	Picon caching is good.  Playback caching is too slow.
	Either require a total cache bytes or a total cache items but not both.
libdv yuv->rgb conversion used again.
version_define.diff version macro renamed
	applied
dv_in_32khz.diff 12 bit hack for 1394
	applied
alsa_fix.diff ALSA API change
	applied
crop_crush.diff new crop interface
	Partially applied.  The corners shouldn't snap to the cursor.
qt_mpeg_cleanup.diff:
	Partially applied.  The temp rows are needed for packed colormodels.
overlay-speedup5.diff TRANSFER_REPLACE overlay optimization: 
	applied
maskengine4* mask engine rewrite:
	rejected - not SMP compatible
masks_fixes.diff new rerendering test + interpolation rewrite
	new rerendering test imported
	new interpolation rejected.  This needs to be done with the existing API
		instead of an orthogonal one.  Try confining it to CWindowGUI.
		Mask points need to interpolate in every
		previous and every next keyframe instead of just the previous.


David Arendt <admin@prnet.org>

xml.diff different xml syntax
	rejected.  These standards points are ignored in 
	most every web page anyway, and Cinelerra exports aren't used by 
	anything else.
render.diff rendering hack
	rejected.  Command line rendering should run without a GUI and do
	batches.



Eric Seigne <eric.seigne@ryxeo.com>

french translation imported



ga <ga@kutxa.homeunix.org>

drag.diff different drag behavior
	rejected.  Most people seem to want arbitary dropping with an 
	option to paste to arbitrary positions.
spanish translation imported



koen muylkens <koen.muylkens@esat.kuleuven.ac.be>

newskin-cinelerra.diff - rejected.  Move Cinelerra specific settings
from BC_Resources to Theme.  Put default values back in BC_Resources so
it can be used by other applications.  Need button picons instead of 3
segment button.  Make splash screen determined by a default field, set
when the user sets a theme.
