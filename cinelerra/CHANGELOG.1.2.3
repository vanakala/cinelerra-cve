H.264 Video, MPEG-4 Audio and Video encoding in Quicktime, compatible with Quicktime player.
 - The ffmpeg front end has been improved to where it generates useful quality.
 - Certain frame rates and compression options don't work in Win.

Refurbished MPEG table of contents.
 - Tables of contents now detect changes in PID.
 - Tables of contents are created twice as fast.
 - Load any MPEG or IFO file with video in Cinelerra and a table of 
   contents is automatically created.
 - Audio indexes are created simultaneously with MPEG tables of contents.
 - Still possible to create permanent tables of contents with mpeg3toc.
 - Using MPEG files in a renderfarm still requires mpeg3toc due to the fact that the
 automatic .toc files are hidden.

Fewer lockups when resizing video window.
Fewer crashes due to socket timeouts in background rendering.
Directory search boxes only contain relevant information for directories.
Hourglass displayed in main window during time consuming operations.
Having shared effect off but sharing instance on doesn't create mono sound anymore.
Tool options get closed when CWindow is closed.
Picture settings retained after recording from V4L2.  Workaround for V4L2 driver
	where 2 different picture settings must be uploaded.
Bitrate displayed in asset info box.
64 bit plugins are stored in /usr/lib64 so 64 bit executables can be run on the
	same systems as 32 bit executables without renaming the directory.
Color picker in compositor window allows selecting colors from the output frame
	for use in effects.
Refurbushed chroma key:
 - uses color cube instead of hue for color comparison
 - uses the color picker to select the color
Support for raw digital camera importing.
 - Uses dcraw to decode the images into floating point RGB.
 - tested on Canon .cr2 and .tiff files.
 - Linearize effect is provided to convert gamma values.
White balance function in colorbalance effect.
 - Select the grey color in the compositor window.
 - Hit the white balance button.

YUV 16 bit colormodels have been depreciated.  The only practical
colormodels have been 8 bit and floating point.  Even with raw sensor
data, the precision needs to be higher to handle the gamma correction.

Difference key using different tracks.
Undo buffers use compression to reduce memory usage.
Undo supports effect tweeks.
Nudge textboxes are ganged.
Mouse wheel changes nudge value.

Holding CTRL when doing any playback operation causes the in/out points to be used
for the playback range.

Moved from the unified camera and projector keyframes to discrete x
and y curves.
 - Z was already made discrete out of necessary utility.
 - Too much information was drawn on the Compositor window.
 - The timeline functionality is extended to better handle curves.

Alt+up and Alt+down zoom the automation vertically.

Dedicated window provided for selecting which automation overlays to show.

The problem with virtual filesystem:
 - VFS was developed back when we wanted to use some high powered servers but
 didn't have root access to mount filesystems on them.  That situation ended and 
 it was taking an enourmous amount of effort to work VFS around the number of 
 strange things libraries do like accessing megabytes using fgetc.  
 VFS has now been phased out.

Fixed lockups due to MWindow locking CWindow when MWindow was still locked.
Fixed problems loading ulaw sound files.

Tip of the day shown.
Filebox supports deleting files and refreshing.
Extra zoom levels added to Compositor window.

Highlighted region overrides in/out points if it is nonzero length.

Blond theme has not been updated.  Instead it has been replaced by the
SUV theme.  The SUV theme is extremely manly and dark and should make
the media stand out more.

MPEG4 audio decodes on x86_64.  Had to put stdint.h in faad.h and
change all the unsigned long to uint32_t because those structures were
redefined in structs.h with uint32_t.

Channel changing for Video4Linux2 ported to kernel 2.6.7. Automatic
channel scanning and sorting is supported for the 1 guy who still uses
these cards.

Pressing ALT while clicking in cropping window causes translation of
all 4 cropping points.

Rotation effect supports a variable pivot and drawing of the pivot in
the frame.

DV support migrated to latest API rewrite: libIEC61883

MPEG video encoding provides a graphical interface for YUV 4:2:0
encoding on the mjpegtools version of mpeg2enc.  

The audio playback options support a global offset for audio
synchronization.  This doesn't affect the audio playback or the
rendering.  It just compensates for inaccuracy in the Linux sound
drivers.

The ALSA options allow compensation for lockups at end of playback
depending on the ALSA version, soundcard, and ALSA rewrite.

Press Tab while the cursor is anywhere over a track to toggle the track
arming status.  Press Shift-Tab while the cursor is over a track to
toggle the arming status of every other track. 

Resample effect changed to match the behavior of the Reframe effects. 
Scale factors > 1 shorten the length of the audio.
