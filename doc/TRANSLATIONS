Here is some information about the manual translation process. It is intended
to be read by the maintainers of the Cinelerra CV manual in other languages
than English.

- To start a new translation, contact the Cinelerra Community. 
  IRC: channel #cinelerra on Freenode. 
  Mailing list: cinelerra@skolelinux.no
- Make sure you have the the latest English manual edition.
- Translate the texinfo file cinelerra_cv_manual_en.texi, and rename it to
  cinelerra_cv_manual_xx.texi, "xx" being the two-letter ISO-639 code of the
  language you translate the manual to.
- Make sure your translated file is saved with ISO-8859 as character encoding 
  standard (UTF-8 is not fully supported by Texinfo, yet). Choose the part of 
  ISO-8859 appropriate for your language (eg: English is part 1 -> ISO-8859-1).
- Copy the manual_images_en folder, and rename it to manual_images_xx
- Change the images location in cinelerra_cv_manual_xx.texi, in order to point
  to the images contained in manual_images_xx
- Avoid changing the texinfo commands as much as possible. If you need some
  information about texinfo, get its excellent manual at www.gnu.org
- Keep as is the edition number of the English manual you fetched.
- Images which contain text are available in .xcf (Gimp) format. Use those to
  convert the text and save them in .png format, using a level 7 compression
  (in Gimp).  Please do not rename the images filenames.
- Test everything works fine by running make_manuals.sh <language code>
- When you have finished, send everything to the Cinelerra CV community.

The translated manual will then be put into the Cinelerra CV repository and 
uploaded to the Cinelerra CV website.

While you translate the manual, chances are that a new edition of the English
manual is released. To keep track of the changes see doc/ChangeLog file. 
To easily find differences between each edition, we recommend you use meld
